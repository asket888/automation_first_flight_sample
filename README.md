This project contains sample of using automation in Web Application testing. One was widely used on real project by manual testers and saves a lot of time on new builds acceptance testing and environment preparation.

This is my first framework so one have a lot of mistakes and mistmaches in aproaches and best practises. But my aim was to create framework for manual testers so main criterion was to make one as simple and supportable as it possible.

Third-party Libraries: Selenium WebDriver, TestNG;
